what material did you send us? -UD/woven
 - 


why do the failure criteria matter?
 - failure parameter 55
 - directional fibres A1 & D2?
 - 


material coordinates 


Do the EOS matter for comp? 
 - EOS in LS-DYNA manual
 - p470 / 1986
 - 

how to model multiple ply and directions
 - fibres are rotated in y-z plane
 - 90 degrees of each other
 - modify the direction

what is 2WAY and TI parameter?
 - depends on the yarns
 - if using shells this matters, don't modify when using solids
 - not a good idea to modify these parameters
 - 

How to proceed with 
 - three elements for each layer
 - layered composites
 - tie brakes between elements - automatic surface to surface tiebrake
 - each surface plie segment set - then select master slave, segment ID (tiebrake)
 - 


How is contact modeled?
 - automatic to surface
 - if problems - contact option 9
 - softg material factor set to 1
