 on UNIX computers note the following change:

 ctrl-c interrupts ls-dyna and prompts for a sense  switch.
 type the desired sense switch: sw1., sw2., etc. to continue
 the execution.  ls-dyna will respond as explained in the users manual

    type                      response
   -----   ------------------------------------------------------------
   quit    ls-dyna terminates.
   stop    ls-dyna terminates.
   sw1.    a restart file is written and ls-dyna terminates.
   sw2.    ls-dyna responds with time and cycle numbers.    
   sw3.    a restart file is written and ls-dyna continues calculations.
   sw4.    a plot state is written and ls-dyna continues calculations.
   sw5.    ls-dyna enters interactive graphics phase.
   swa.    ls-dyna flushes all output i/o buffers.
   swb.    a dynain is written and ls-dyna continues calculations.
   swc.    a restart and dynain are written and ls-dyna contiunues calculations.
   swd.    a restart and dynain are written and ls-dyna terminates.
   lpri    toggle implicit lin. alg. solver output on/off.
   nlpr    toggle implicit nonlinear solver output on/off.
   iter    toggle implicit output to d3iter database on/off.
   prof    output timing data to prof.out and continue.
   conv    force implicit nonlinear convergence for current time step.
   ttrm    terminate implicit time step, reduce time step, retry time step.
   rtrm    terminate implicit at end of current time step.
