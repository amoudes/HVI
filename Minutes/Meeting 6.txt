SUMMARY MEETING
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 - MJC mat card doesn't work with SPH. We can pick a similar aluminium card instead with JC.
 - Flip the excel order of t/d and velocity to see if the sensitivity changes in the PCA analysis.
 - Cloud shape is also affected by material and parameter choices. We can dedicate a section in the report
   to a qualitive study of the cloud shape. (Maybe nicely summarize it with a table).
 
 - Prepare some slides for next week Monday's meeting with Tore with PCA etc. with clear conclusions. 
 - For now we can start writing on the home reports about what the simulations that we have done in the past
   couple of weeks.
