SUMMARY MEETING
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 - Goal of project is not yet defined. Sort of goal is to experiment with different settings in LS-DYNA (sims) and see whether we are
   able to find a pattern in the simulations. Since actual testing takes a while and is expensive most experiments will be performed
   numerically.
 - We can think of several parameters we think of a lot of possibilities within the project, for instance:
	- Composite material - find material cards
	- Additive manufactures materials
	- Changing density
	- Changing projectile material, Alu foam
 - We can peform some tests to have some kind of comparison between numerics and experiments.
   Sort of simulate HVI using lower velocities by changing the impactor material. 
   Most important is the debris cloud after impact
 - Thesis Rannveig showed that non-linear Equations of State (EOS) are mostly not necessary and linear equations suffice in HVI. 


 - The goal of the project is open ended at the moment. I should first get acquainted with LS-DYNA
 - Secondly we can dive into different material properties of the shields. The outer shield is always made of aluminium.
   Later shields can be made of composite or something else...

 - Basically we have quite some freedom to do what we would like to do at the moment. What is can do right now is:
	- Literature study on different materials, ID cards etc.
	- Study LS-DYNA
	- Think about project set-up
